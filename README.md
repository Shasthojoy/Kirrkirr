Kirrkirr
========

Software for the exploration of indigenous language dictionaries.

Kirrkirr was actively developed as an interface to indigenous language dictionaries in the late 1990s (starting with Java 1.1.5!) and early 2000s. Things have been quiet for the last few years, though some loyal users have continued to get value from it. The original version was written entirely in Java 1.1 so as to remain compatible with pre-OS X PowerPC Macs.

I've started trying to update it for the 2010s. The version here is the current attempt. At the moment it runs about as well as it ever did.
